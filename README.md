<h1>SYSTEMS CHECK NUMBER 2</h1>

<h2>GOAL:</h2>
<p>
The NFL has tasked you with building a web site that tracks game results as the season progresses. In this assignment, you will build a Sinatra application that displays a leaderboard. (For the non-sports fans, a leaderboard is a scoreboard that shows the name, number of wins, and number of losses for each team in the league.) Use the data below. You may either hard-code the data into your application or read it in from a CSV.

FEATURES:

  <li>Bootstrap added to clean up tables! (looking good!)</li>
  <li>Dynamic data & route generation</li>

</ol>
